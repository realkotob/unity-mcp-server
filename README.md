## Architecture

```
Claude / AI Assistant ←→ MCP Server (this repo) ←→ Unity Editor Plugin (HTTP bridge)
                                ↕
                          Unity Hub CLI
```

This server communicates with:
- **Unity Hub** via its CLI (supports both modern `--headless` and legacy `-- --headless` syntax)
- **Unity Editor** via the companion [unity-mcp-plugin](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin) which runs an HTTP API inside the editor

### Two-Tier Tool System

To avoid overwhelming MCP clients with 200+ tools, the server uses a two-tier architecture:
- **Core tools** (~70) are always exposed directly
- **Advanced tools** (~130+) are accessed via a single `unity_advanced_tool` proxy with lazy loading

This keeps the tool count manageable for clients like Claude Desktop and Cowork while still providing access to every Unity feature. Use `unity_list_advanced_tools` to discover all advanced tools by category.

### Multi-Instance Support

The server automatically discovers all running Unity Editor instances on startup. If only one instance is found, it auto-connects. If multiple instances are running (e.g., main editor + ParrelSync clones), it prompts you to select which one to work with.

**Port Resilience** — The server includes a multi-layer protection system for reliable multi-project workflows:

- **Port Identity Validation** — When restoring a saved connection, the server verifies the instance identity (project name + path) matches the expected target. If Unity restarts and a different project grabs the port, the server detects this and re-discovers the correct instance.
- **Compile-Time Resilience** — During long Unity compiles (when the editor is unresponsive), the server checks the shared instance registry. If the registry entry is fresh (updated within the last 5 minutes via heartbeat), the connection is preserved instead of dropped.
- **Crash Detection** — The plugin sends a heartbeat every 30 seconds to the instance registry. If Unity crashes and the heartbeat stops, the server detects the stale registry entry (>5 minutes old) and clears it, allowing proper re-discovery.
- **Port Affinity** — The plugin remembers its last-used port via EditorPrefs and reclaims it on restart, minimizing port swaps across editor restarts.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Unity Plugin

In Unity: **Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from git URL:**
```
https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin.git
```

### 2. Install this MCP Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server.git
cd unity-mcp-server
npm install
```

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop > Settings > Developer > Edit Config, and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/unity-mcp-server/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_HUB_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Unity Hub\\Unity Hub.exe",
        "UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT": "7890"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Done!

### 4. Try It

The Unity plugin also has its own settings accessible via the Dashboard (`Window > MCP Dashboard`) for port, auto-start, and per-category feature toggles.

## Optional Package Support

Some tools activate automatically when their packages are detected in the Unity project:

| Package / Asset | Features Unlocked |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `com.unity.memoryprofiler` | Memory snapshot capture via MemoryProfiler API |
| `com.unity.shadergraph` | Shader Graph creation, inspection, opening |
| `com.unity.visualeffectgraph` | VFX Graph listing and opening |
| `com.unity.inputsystem` | Input Action map and binding inspection |
| `com.unity.multiplayer.playmode` | MPPM scenario listing, activation, start/stop, player info |
| Amplify Shader Editor (Asset Store) | Amplify shader listing, inspection, opening |

Features for uninstalled packages return helpful messages explaining what to install.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Unity Hub (for Hub tools)
- Unity Editor with [unity-mcp-plugin](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin) installed (for Editor tools)

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed" errors** — Make sure Unity Editor is open and the plugin is installed. Check the Unity Console for `[MCP Bridge] Server started on port 7890`.

**"Unity Hub not found"** — Update `UNITY_HUB_PATH` in your config to match your installation.

**"Category disabled" errors** — A feature category may be toggled off. Open `Window > MCP Dashboard` in Unity to check category settings.

**Port conflicts** — Change `UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT` in your Claude config and update the port in Unity's MCP Dashboard settings.

## Why AnkleBreaker Unity MCP?

### Cost Comparison

> **AnkleBreaker Unity MCP is completely free and open source.** The prices below reflect only the cost of the AI assistant (Claude) itself — the MCP plugin and server are $0.

| Solution | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|----------|:----------:|--------------| 
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Pro** | **$20/mo** | 200+ tools, full Unity control, open source — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Max 5x** | **$100/mo** | Same + 5x usage for heavy workflows — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Max 20x** | **$200/mo** | Same + 20x usage for teams/studios — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **Bezi Pro** | $20/mo | ~30 tools, 800 credits/mo, freezes Unity |
| **Bezi Advanced** | $60/mo | ~30 tools, 2400 credits/mo, freezes Unity |
| **Bezi Team** | $200/mo | 3 seats, 8000 credits, still freezes Unity |
| **Unity AI** | Included with Unity Pro/Enterprise | Limited AI tools, Unity Points system, no MCP |
| **Coplay MCP** | Free (beta) | 34 tools, basic categories |

### Key Advantages

**vs. Bezi:**
Bezi runs as a proprietary Unity plugin with its own credit-based billing — $20–$200/mo on top of your AI subscription. It has historically suffered from freezing the Unity Editor during AI tasks, blocking your workflow. AnkleBreaker MCP is completely free and open source, runs entirely in the background with zero editor impact, and offers 6x more tools — the only cost is your existing Claude subscription.

**vs. Coplay MCP:**
Coplay MCP provides 34 tools across ~5 categories. AnkleBreaker MCP delivers 200+ tools across 30+ categories including advanced features like physics raycasts, terrain editing, shader graph management, profiling, NavMesh, particle systems, and MPPM multiplayer — none of which exist in Coplay. Our two-tier lazy loading system is specifically optimized for Claude Cowork's tool limits.

**vs. Unity AI:**
Unity AI (successor to Muse) is built into Unity 6.2+ but limited to Unity's own AI models and a credit-based "Unity Points" system. It cannot be used with Claude or any external AI assistant, has no MCP support, and offers a fraction of the automation capabilities. AnkleBreaker MCP works with any MCP-compatible AI while giving you full control over which AI models you use.

## What's New in v2.22.2

- **Multi-project port identity** — The server now validates that a persisted instance selection actually matches the expected project (by name and path) before reconnecting. If a different Unity project grabbed the same port after a restart, the server detects the mismatch and re-discovers the correct instance automatically.
- **Compile-time resilience** — When a Unity Editor is unresponsive (e.g., during a long compile), the server checks the shared instance registry before dropping the connection. Fresh registry entries (updated by the plugin's 30-second heartbeat) indicate the editor is still alive, preventing unnecessary disconnects during compiles.
- **Crash detection** — If Unity crashes and the plugin's `OnDisable` never fires, the registry entry goes stale (no heartbeat updates). The server detects entries older than 5 minutes as crashed instances and clears them, allowing proper re-discovery. The staleness timeout is configurable via `UNITY_REGISTRY_STALENESS_TIMEOUT`.
- **Enhanced instance discovery** — Both registry fallback paths in `validateSelectedInstance()` now check entry staleness, giving three-scenario coverage: normal shutdown (clean unregister), long compile (fresh entry = keep connection), and crash (stale entry = re-discover).
